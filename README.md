Hi, my name is Martin! I’m a student from Germany currently learning software development. On my profile, you’ll find a variety of projects and exercises I’ve worked on to improve my skills. Feel free to take a look around, and I’d love to hear any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

I have experience in programming languages like Python and C#, and I’m currently diving into React Native to develop mobile applications. For fun, I also create games in Unity. Additionally, I’m passionate about learning more about algorithms, data structures, and software design patterns to deepen my understanding of software development.

Thanks for visiting my profile! I hope you find my projects both interesting and informative.

P.S. Yes, this text was initially written with the help of ChatGPT—but hey, I’m constantly refining my skills, even in writing!
