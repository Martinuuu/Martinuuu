Hi, my name is Martin! I am a student from Germany currently learning software development. On my profile, you'll find a variety of projects and exercises that I've worked on to improve my skills. Feel free to take a look around and leave any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

I am experienced in programming languages such as Python and C#, and I am currently focusing on learning React Native to develop mobile applications. I also make some games in Unity for fun and I am also interested in learning more about algorithms, data structures and software design patterns.

Thank you for visiting my profile and I hope you find my projects interesting and informative.

... and of course this damn text is written by ChatGPT, like im writing this all by myself.
